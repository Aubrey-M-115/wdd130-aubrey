#list: food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) or eating out, 
# water (calculate water),
#hotel (different hotel for each night), 
# mile plan per day and gas consumption,
#map,
#cash on the side for safety
# supplies i.e.: blanket, pillow, shoes, shirt, pants, undergarments, socks, hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, water bottle, cleansing stuff, jacket, swimsuit, etc.
# cost of gas, food, supplies not purchased, snacks, cash to be taken out




# It would start on figuring out lists of what each thing on the earlier written list
#In that list, take in the cost of everything and calculate the total
#Make a seperate list for supplies and return the list for people to see.
#For mileage, determine the miles and divide that by miles per gallon. Then multiply that by the cost per gallon based on where you plan to stop at.
# Once that is all done, add the cost of everything. show that cost and print the supply list
# Make a function that shows everything on the list, and when it is done, you write it down on the bar, and it gets deleted once packed.

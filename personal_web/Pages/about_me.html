            <p> Hi, my name is Aubrey. I have played volleyball for 7 years now. I've played club ball for 2
                years, but now play intramural volleyball at college. Volleyball has always been a joy for me as
                I've grown and been a rock for me when life got harder. I want to give people an opening to
                something I have found that helps me</p>

                    <a class='Positions' href="positions.html">Positions</a>
                    <p>There are 7 positions in volleyball. Each position focuses on each playerâ€™s strengths in the way
                        they play.</p>
                    <p>Libero: Libero is a defensive position in the back row of the court. They wear
                        different colored jerseys and are able to switch with the players who are in the same positions
                        (usually seen in the middles). They are usually best at reading hitters and reacting to the
                        ball.</p>
                    <p>DS: Defensive specialist are players that play defense usually alongside the libero.
                        Unlike the libero, they can only switch with one player (like all the other players).</p>
                    <p>Setter: Setters are players who control the ball during the second touch. They set the ball to
                        hitters.</p>
                    or tip the ball. Setters tend to have a great sense of the court and a great sense of mentality.
                    <p>Outside: Outside hitters tend to be the most all-around players in offense and defense. They hit
                        on the left side and are usually used in back row defense to prevent the setter from receiving
                        the serve.</p>
                    <p>Middle: The middle is known as a powerful hitter and great blocker. They tend to be
                        really good with timing and reading the hitter on the opposite side when blocking.</p>
                    <p>Opposite: The opposite is the right side hitter. They tend to be a good blocker and reliable in
                        being able to adjust for the setter.</p>
                    <p>Serving Specialist: Serving specialists are players that are known for
                        their serves and swap in with the player about to serve. Once the other team gets the point,
                        they are swapped back out with the original player</p>
